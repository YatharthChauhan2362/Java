Handling specific Exceptions
In java, we can handle specific exceptions by typing multiple catch blocks.

Syntax:

try (

    // code

    )

   Catch (To Exception e) - Handle all Exceptions of type IO Exception

        // code

        )

   Catch (Exception e) - Handle all Exceptions of type Arithmetic Exception

        // code

         ) 

   Catch (Exception e) - Handle all other Exceptions

        // code

        )
