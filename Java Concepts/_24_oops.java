// Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
// This Program was Created By Yatharth Chauhan

// Object-Oriented Programming tries to map code instructions with real-world,
// making the code short and easier to understand.

// With the help of OOPs, we try to implement real-world entities such as
// object, inheritance, abstraction, etc.

// OOPs helps us to follow the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) approach of
// programming, which in turn increases the reusability of the code.

// Two most important aspects of OOPs - Classes & Objects :

// Class :
// A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
// Classes do not consume any space in the memory.
// Objects inherit methods and variables from the class.
// It is a logical component.

// Objects :
// An object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template
// (info) is defined.
// Every object has some address, and it occupies some space in the memory.
// It is a physical entity.
// Take a look at the below example to get a better understanding of objects and
// classes.

// How to model a problem in OOPs
// We identify the following:

// Basic Terminologies in Object Oriented Programming

// Four pillars of Object-Oriented-Programming Language :

// Abstraction :
// Let's suppose you want to turn on the bulb in your room. What do you do to
// switch on the bulb. You simply press the button and the light bulb turns on.
// Right? Notice that here you're only concerned with your final result, i.e.,
// turning on the light bulb. You do not care about the circuit of the bulb or
// how current flows through the bulb. The point here is that you press the
// switch, the bulb turns on! You don't know how the bulb turned on/how the
// circuit is made because all these details are hidden from you. This
// phenomenon is known as abstraction.
// More formally, data abstraction is the way through which only the essential
// info is shown to the user, and all the internal details remain hidden from
// the user.

// Polymorphism :
// One entity many forms.
// The word polymorphism comprises two words, poly which means many, and morph,
// which means forms.
// In OOPs, polymorphism is the property that helps to perform a single task in
// different ways.
// Let us consider a real-life example of polymorphism. A woman at the same time
// can be a mother, wife, sister, daughter, etc. Here, a woman is an entity
// having different forms.
// Let's take another example, a smartphone can work like a camera as well as
// like a calculator. So, you can see the a smartphone is an entity having
// different forms.

// Encapsulation :
// The act of putting various components together (in a capsule).
// In java, the variables and methods are the components that are wrapped inside
// a single unit named class.
// All the methods and variables of a class remain hidden from any other class.
// A automatic cold drink vending machine is an example of encapsulation.
// Cold drinks inside the machine are data that is wrapped inside a single unit
// cold drink vending machine.

// Inheritance :
// The act of deriving new things from existing things.
// In Java, one class can acquire all the properties and behaviours of other
// some other class
// The class which inherits some other class is known as child class or sub
// class.
// The class which is inherited is known as parent class or super class.
// Inheritance helps us to write more efficient code because it increases the
// reusablity of the code.
// Example :
// Rickshaw → E-Rickshaw
// Phone → Smart Phone
